# Hunter Harding's Web Portoflio!

This is my personal web portfolio that I built to increase my web presence, create a vector that people can easily contact me at, and to show that I have successfully taught myself a great deal of front-end development concepts. It has links to linkedIn/Twitter/Github/resume.pdf, a content body, projects panel, and a contact me page.
